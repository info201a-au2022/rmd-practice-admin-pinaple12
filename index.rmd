## COVID Deaths and Cases

The number of cases that have occured since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic is `r get_total_cases()`. While this may seem like a lot of cases, it may be relieving to hear that the virus does not have a 100% mortality rate. The total amount of deaths since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic is `r get_total_deaths()`.
